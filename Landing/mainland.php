            <h3>Maintenance</h3>
            <p>
                The Maintenance category is divided into 3 main types.
                <ul>
                    <li>Check Up  is oriented for keeping track of when the last machinery/medical check-ups were done. From the last oil change
                    with a notice 6 months from that, to a yearly blood test that always slips the mind, this type is flexible in its use. </li>
                    <li>Insurance provides support for any type of legal documentation that requires regular updates, so the police isn't the one to remind you of your expired insurance.</li>
                    <li>Spare Parts was created for those who are always running out of motherboards, SSDs and other nicknacks that may seem unimportant, but are higly vital for a great repair job</li>
                </ul>
