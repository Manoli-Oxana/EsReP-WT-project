            <p>
                The Resources category is focused on quantifiable entries that are more common in day-to-day life.
                <ul>
                    <li>Food is an always up to date shopping list and a useful tool in keeping the inventory stock full.</li>
                    <li>Fuel keeps track of both the liquid type like gasoline, and the solid ones, like wood, coal so you don't have to worry of running out and freezing this winter.</li>
                    <li>Medicine allows the user to know which medicine they have to stock up on in the winter season without having to dig up and rearange the medicine drawer.</li>
                    <li>Office Supplies provides the necessary logistic support for companies and the unfortunate souls that trick their brain into believing they are productive.</li>
                    <li>Tools was created for DIY-ers that always seem to be running out of screws, nails, and even hammers or drills.</li>
                    <li>Make-Up subcategory is a must for any make-up lover that has a hard time remembering the expiration dates of their vast make-up collection.</li>
